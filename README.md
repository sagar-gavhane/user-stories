### User Stories

A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a
description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user story
describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story helps to create
a simplified description of a requirement.

A good way to think about a user story is that it is a reminder to have a
conversation with your customer, which is another way to say it's a reminder to
do some just-in-time analysis. In short, user stories are very slim and
high-level requirements artifacts.

I have created **[template](./TEMPLATE.md)** in markdown for making user
stories.
